LED has shown many unique advantages as a new type of light source and has been widely used. Thus, our demand for testing problems of LED performance is gradually increasing.Inthispaper,weimprovedthecurrentLEDtestdeviceanddevelopedthe LED brightness test device. The main work is as follows: 1. Improvement of the LED control system based on stm32. 2. Improvement of the LED power supply system. 3. Integrate the separate modules to make a PCB. 4. Implement a 3D printed shell. This paper emphatically expounds on the electrical hardware design and software design principle and realization of the test device in detail.
